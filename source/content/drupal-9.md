This how-to guide walks you through the high level, end-to-end deployment steps to set up Drupal 9 on the Pantheon WebOps platform.

## About Drupal 9

Drupal 9 includes many of the features and layout that Drupal 8 users are familiar with, and it removes deprecated code to help improve future Drupal development.

Drupal 9 updates Drupalâ€™s underlying dependencies like [Symfony 4.4](https://symfony.com/releases/4.4) and [Twig 2](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/index.html), removes several deprecated API functions in favor of better options, and allows everyone running Drupal 8.8+ an easy upgrade path to Drupal 9 and beyond.

## Drupal 9 With Integrated Composer

On the Pantheon Platform, Drupal 9 sites use [Integrated Composer](/integrated-composer), letting you deploy your site on Pantheon with one-click updates for both upstream commits and Composer dependencies, while still receiving upstream updates.

<Alert title="A note about Limited Availability" type="info" icon="leaf">

Currently, Drupal 9 is available on Pantheon as a Limited Availability feature release. This means the feature is currently in active development.

Pantheon engineers are rolling out changes often.

### Managing Dependencies with Composer

Learn more about working with upstream and site dependencies in the [Integrated Composer](/integrated-composer) documentation.

## Before You Begin

- Log in to your Pantheon account. If you don't have one, [create one first](https://pantheon.io/register?docs) and familiarize yourself with the [User Dashboard](/guides/quickstart/user-dashboard) before you create a new site.

- Set up [SSH Keys](/ssh-keys) on your local computer and Pantheon account.

- Install and configure [Git](/git) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) on your local computer.

   - Mac users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install both Git and Composer, along with their required dependencies:

     ```bash{promptUser:user}
     brew install git composer
     ```

## Create a New Drupal 9 Site with Integrated Composer

If you're not ready to create a new site yet, you can also [check an existing site's compatibility to upgrade](/guides/drupal-9-migration/prepare).

## Upgrade or Migrate to Drupal 9

To upgrade or migrate an existing Drupal site to Drupal 9 with Integrated Composer, see the [Drupal 9 Migration Guide](/guides/drupal-9-migration).

## Troubleshooting and Support

For example, `node_load()` was replaced in Drupal 9 with `Node::load` resulting in this change needed:

Drupal 8:

```php
$node = node_load(1);
```

Drupal 9:

```php
use \Drupal\node\Entity\Node;
$node = Node::load(1);
```

Since most of these changes are relatively minor, there are a number of [deprecation checking and correction tools](https://www.drupal.org/docs/9/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9/deprecation-checking-and-correction-tools) available.

## FAQ

### Can I upgrade my existing Drupal site to Drupal 9?

Not yet. While Drupal 9 on Pantheon is in Limited Availability, there is no supported upgrade path yet.

### Pantheon Launch Check Status Error: services.yml does not exist

After you set up Drupal 9, you might see this error in the **Best practices** section of the Pantheon Launch Check:

> <span  style="color:red">x <strong>sites/default/services.yml:</strong></span> services.yml does not exist! Copy the default.service.yml to services.yml and see https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/settings-file for details.
><br />
><br />
>
> *Create services.yml file inside sites/default directory by copying default/services.yml file. See https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/settings-file for details.*

Ensure your site's [Development Mode](/guides/quickstart/connection-modes/) is set to **Git**, then use the terminal on the local machine where you cloned the site, and from the project's root directory:

1. Copy `default.services.yml` to `services.yml`:

 ```bash{promptUser: user}
 cp web/sites/default/default.services.yml web/sites/default/services.yml
 ```

1. Commit and push:

 ```bash{promptUser: user}
 git add web/sites/default/services.yml && git commit -m "init services.yml"
 git push origin master
  ```
